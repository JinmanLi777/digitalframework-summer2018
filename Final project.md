# Chinese direct investment in the U.S. may continue to decline under Cfius law and other influence
By Jinman Li

An act that would expand the oversight on foreign investment was signed into law by the president on August 13 as part of a defense authorization package. It reforms the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an inter-agency committee, strengthening its power to investigate – and potentially block – foreign transactions for national security concerns. 

The Cfius law "modernization" is a euphemism for addressing concerns about Chinese investments, some of which couldn't be effectively reviewed under the previous Cfius framework, White & Case LLP, an international law firm, wrote in a note to clients. 

The legislation was prompted by concerns about the outbound transfer of strategic technologies and personal data mainly but not exclusively to China. Cfius was thrust into the spotlight when it blocked the acquisition of Moneygram, a U.S. money-transfer firm, by Ant Financial, a Chinese online payments company affiliated with Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. It also intervened in the planned takeover of Qualcomm by a Singapore rival, Broadcom, over national security concerns. 

However, most of the changes in the law will not take effect until implementing regulations are in place, which must occur within the next 18 months. Before that, the government will tend to slow or even in some cases freeze their decision-making process to avoid the potential confrontation with the new law, said Joseph Minarik, senior vice president and director of research at the Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board.

Despite the uncertainties in implementation, the concerns raised toward the Cfius law will have a "measurable impact" on the Chinese investment in the U.S., Minarik said. Chinese direct investment in the U.S. declined by 36 percent to $30 billion in 2017, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider.

One of the reasons is that the Chinese government has stepped up scrutiny over outbound capital flows since late 2016 to curb currency depreciation. Beijing will continue to guard against a repeat of 2015-2016, a peak in China's outbound investment, Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, wrote in a July report. He is also the creator of the China Global Investment Tracker, a data set covering China's global investment and construction published by AEI. 

In the scenario that hostility has been growing toward China's state-owned enterprises over the government-backed acquisitions, how much private companies spend becomes the "determining factor" for Chinese direct investment in both the U.S. and other countries, Scissors wrote in the report. 

"Private firms do not dictate the PRC's investment pattern; Beijing does. Still, they can make the difference between a series of $130 billion years or a series of $160 billion years," Scissor wrote.

Multiple factors are in play when it comes to the prediction of China's investment in the U.S, said Minarik. If China's economy could pick up steam from the current slowdown due to the U.S.-China trade disputes, the investment would increase. Meanwhile, the declining Chinese currency value against the U.S. dollar makes it more expensive to invest in the U.S., said Minarik.

The tit-for-tat U.S.-China trade war and the status of bilateral negotiations also spill over to affect the investment, Minarik said. 

"Restrictions on investment are complements to measures designed to reduce the overall trade surplus in China and the U.S. trade deficit. The two goes hand in hand," said Robert E. Scott, senior economist at Economic Policy Institute, a Democratic-oriented economic policy think tank. 

So far, $50 billion worth of each country's goods have been targeted. The U.S. has threatened to slap 25 percent tariffs on additional $200 of Chinese goods, and China has vowed to retaliate with tariffs on another $60 billion of American goods. 

A two-day talk led by mid-level U.S. and China officials was held last week, the first face-to-face U.S.-China meetings since early June. In a statement last Friday, China's commerce ministry said both sides had a "constructive" and "candid" exchange over trade issues and will stay in touch on the next steps.  The two sides didn't reach any joint agreement on the talk. 

Earlier, President Trump downplayed the possibility of major progress achieved by this round of talks in an interview with Reuters. 

"The two sides have chosen relatively junior people to take part in that round of negotiations, which is an indication that even if those negotiators can find some measure of agreement, the results will only require further negotiation by more senior negotiators," said Minarik, who said the "somewhat discouraging" prospects of agreements would also lead to a smaller China-U.S. direct investment.
