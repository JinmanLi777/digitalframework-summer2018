When I looked at the data, I firstly found that in the first and the fifth column, there is a suffix "fsb" after many banks' names. It stands for a federal savings bank. At the first glance I thought there may be inconsistences in the names since some of them are in upper class, some in lower cases, some follow a comma and some do not. However, after selecting all the banks with this suffix using the find and replace function in Excel, I checked them online one by one and found that there was no mistakes in these names according to their official websites and the records in FDIC. So I decided to leave these name as they are.
The next step I thought of, is to seperate the year from month and date in the columns of "closeing date" and "updated date," becuase it will be helpful if we could check which year the bank was closed in the data analysis process. I did this by using the "text to columns" function in excel.
