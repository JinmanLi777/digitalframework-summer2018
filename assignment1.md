# Assignment 1
Due date: July 11
## First story idea:
The story angle may be to discover the relationship between the trend of foreign direct investment in the U.S. in recent years and the administration's policies on this, compared with several other countries that may be comparable with the U.S. or are involved in the trade surplus issues with the U.S. such as China and some NATO countries. The New Foreign Direct Investment in the United States in 2017 will be released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Wednesday, which could serve as a good source of data. Also, the timing of the story may be good because the U.S. congress just passed a bill to expand a committee’s power to regulate foreign investments, and this tightening trend has been going on for a while. The China government, on the other hand, has loosened its grip on foreign investments recently. The contrasting foreign investment policies and their effect on the actual investment may be newsworthy and still evolving. 

### Key question: What are the changes in foreign direct investment in 2017 compared with previous years?

#### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.  Answer:4 
What was it? Foreign investors are becoming the biggest buyers of Chinese government bond. 
Was it in the headline? Yes. 
Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent Answer:5 
Was that the most efficient way to navigate? Yes 
Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? It’s easy to navigate although I think data visualization should take up a bigger portion of the story since it’s a data-driven topic. 
Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate
List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. I think instead of using data from a private company, the journalist should try to find data compiled by the government, which may be more comprehensive in terms of tallying foreign investments. 
List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. Chinese government’s finance department 
Did they provide a source? Yes. 
Did they explain everything that needed explaining? I think so. 

#### Objective: Quality
Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) Answer: 3
Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. First of all, I think one chart doesn’t suffice for this story and at least charts of the investment composition of different nations and of the proportion that foreign investment take in total investment should be presented in order to make the story complete. Second, although the chart managed to show the growing trend of foreign investment, it doesn’t offer much information in terms of the specific amount of investment. 

#### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? No. I think the green shade without annotation makes it difficult for the audience to recognize the changes of foreign investment in different time periods. A line chart would have done a better job. 

## Second story idea:
My second story idea concerns the banking habits of citizens in different countries and for different generations. For example, the U.S. people are known for not prone to making deposits at banks, but what about the Millennials? What are the financial options and how do people of different age ranges manage their money? Also, apart from comparing several countries’ saving habits, I may try to interview experts and explore some data such as interest rates and income level to figure out what would be the factors affecting people’s banking habits. 

### Key question: How much deposits do people make in banks per year in the U.S. and in other countries?

#### Objective: Clarity and accuracy
Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.
Answer: 3
What was it? The Millennials’ actual saving habits revealed by the survey is breaking the stereotype that older generations have on them. 
Was it in the headline? Yes. 
Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent Answer: 3
Was that the most efficient way to navigate? No, because I think as the story is kind of data-heavy, it would make sense to create several infographics to present the data rather than just inserting them into a natural flow of narration. 
Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? I actually think the current way of grouping paragraphs by the contents’ inherent logic is good, but infographic that would illustrate the numbers in a more vivid way may do a better job, with brief text explanation attached to it. 
Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate Answer: 4
List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.
List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.
Did they provide a source? Yes. The sources are banks and research organizations. 
Did they explain everything that needed explaining? I think so. 

#### Objective: Quality
Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) 2
Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.  I think the story cited very good sources of data, but the reported didn’t try to visualize the data instead of stating the numbers.
