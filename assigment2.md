* I want to do a story about the relationship between the trend of foreign direct investment in the U.S. in recent years and the administration's policies on this, compared with several other countries that may be comparable with the U.S. or are involved in the trade surplus issues with the U.S. such as China and some NATO countries.

* A list of the things you want to know about any data point
The largest and fastest-growing sources of FDI (foreign direct investment) for the U.S., China, Russia, Canada and the EU and the amount of them in 2015-2018. 
* An explanation of how you'd go about collecting that data (you don't actually have to do it on an ongoing basis, especially if it involves staking something out, just tell me how you would do it).

The data sources will be these countries’ department of commerce and some research organizations such as the Rhodium Group. 
* A table including at least five data points in this dataset

I haven’t finish gathering the data for other countries yet but will be able to find it via the sources I listed above.
