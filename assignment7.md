I found that among the three final candidates for the 2018 U.S. Senate election in Virginia, the incumbent Senator Tim Kaine’s total receipts are ten times of those that the Republican and Liberty challengers each has received. 

To follow up on this story, I will further check out the three candidates’ background and their campaigns. I will also examine the composition of Kaine’s contributors and compare them with those of his challengers. I would also check Kaine’s receipt history in previous elections. To give context to Kaine’s contributions, I will compare Kaine’s total receipts with the candidates in other states and interview some election experts for explanation. The story would take 2-3 days to report. 

**Data acquisition process**
1. Navigated the FEC website to “campaign finance data.” Selected Virginia and checked the data for the 2018 senate election. 
2. Selected the three final candidates and exported a CSV file of the results. 
3. Used the “sort” function to order the candidates’ info by their total receipts. 

**Headline**
Virginia’s incumbent Democratic senator collects ten times the campaign fund of his competitors 

**Nut graph**
The Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who has been an incumbent since 2013, has raised more than $13 million for the Senate election this year. The receipts outnumber tenfold of those that his primary competitor, Republican’s Corey Stewart, has received.
