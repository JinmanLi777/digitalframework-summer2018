2.	Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from 

David Dollar
Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Global Economy and Development, John L. Thornton China Center

Experts in research institutes such as the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution and the Conference Board.

Experts from the Rhodium Group 

Quotes from a report by David Dollar, which was published on the Brookings Institution in 2015:
“The small amount of U.S. investment in China can be traced to two primary factors: 

1.Poor protection of property rights, including intellectual property rights, which limits the potential benefits that U.S. firms can receive from their technology and brands; 

2.China’s restrictions on direct investment in many sectors important to U.S. firms. Among G-20 countries, China is the most restrictive in terms of openness to direct investment.

The relatively small amount of Chinese investment in the United States can also be traced to two factors: 

1.Much of the initial impetus for Chinese firms to go out was to secure natural resources, while the United States is not a resource-rich country relative to its gross domestic product or population;

2.The national security reviews of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States have soured many Chinese investors on the U.S. market.”

3.	What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize
The changes in U.S. foreign direct investment and China FDI in 2014-2017. 
The changes in China’s position in US FDI and the changes in US’s position in China FDI
China’s FDI in the U.S. states

4.	What your news hook is - why is this timely?
Congress passed a bill last week to strengthen and expand the powers of the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments for national security concerns. The bill, although didn’t explicitly mention China as the target of increased scrutiny, China is the “implicit focus.”

Other measures that the U.S. is taking against China are tariffs on goods ranging from aluminum to automobiles, and efforts to prevent the expansion in the U.S. of Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp.

5.	What question will you answer with your data, and why is it newsworthy?
How have the foreign direct investment changed over time in U.S. and China as the two countries’ related policies changed? U.S. seems to be tightening its restriction on China’s investment while China seems to be loosening its control on this aspect. 

What position does the U.S. take in China’s FDI and what position does China take in US’s FDI? It’s interesting that both the two countries take a relatively low position in the other country’s FDI, compared with their positions in the global economy.
